================================================================================
1 Never do

- never give a recipes the name wit "_" (underscore). Only the "-" is allowed.
- never give a name to a recipes in camelCase. Only use small letters.
- never rename a (project) folder after you build the image, sdk or whatever.
  Because absolute pathes are past into the enviroment scripts, your toolbox
  will not work anymore correct.
